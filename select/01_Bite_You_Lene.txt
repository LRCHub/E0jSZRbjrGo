Just cuz I have red hair
That don't mean that I'm red down there
Just cuz I like it rough
That don't mean that I'm open to your stuff
Just cuz I push things fast
That don't mean you can tap that ass
Here comes the prechorus
This is how I do it

Do
Dodo
Just cuz I like don't mean I won't bite you
Do
Dodo
Just cuz I like you don't mean I won't bite you

Just cuz I buy nice clothes
That don't mean you can wear me out
Just cuz u rub my back
Don't mean I wanna hit it right now
And just cuz I wear high heels
That don't mean this girl for sale
Here comes the prechorus
This is how I do it

Repeat Chorus

Your pussycats angry
Cuz you left her home
And I don't appreciate
The way you been treating her lately
So if I was you
This is what I'd do
I'd run home for dinner baby please
Run home to your pussy
